<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! 👋 I'm Tallal, a driven Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and Web Development 🌐. I'm fascinated by the ways AI can transform problem-solving and enhance user experiences.

  My current focus includes coursework in algorithms, data structures, programming paradigms, and web technologies. I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world projects involving AI, web development, and potentially even the integration of spatial data analysis.
  
  Outside of the classroom, my interest include basketball 🏀, working out 💪 or hiking⛰️.
  
  I'm always open to discussing ideas, projects, or career opportunities in these fields. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or via email!</p>
